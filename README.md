# AHK Luancher for the Steam version of the TF ReEngergized project.
A quick and simple launcher for the ReEngergized project. Built with AHK

Requires you to install AutoHotKey, so nab the current version (not the v2 beta) from https://www.autohotkey.com/ or https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/releases

Besure to put the two reg files into the same directory as this launcher. It will yell at you if you didn't.

Make sure they are named the way the discord bot gave them to you. IE: tfcwfc_pc.reg & tfcfoc_pc.reg
